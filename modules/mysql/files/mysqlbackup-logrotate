# This rotates the MySQL backups
# We could do the dump in the postrotate, but we leave it in cron to allow easy manual dumps
# A useful way to check this is doing what you expect is:
# logrotate -vf /etc/logrotate.d/mysqlbackup 
/var/backups/mysql/mysql.backup {
        daily
        rotate 7
        nocreate
        compress
}
