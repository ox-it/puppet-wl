* You can alter the Domain line to list the filesystems you wish to have
* automatically backed up. It is sensible to exclude from this list 
* any filesystems used only for temporary files, for example /tmp and 
* /var/tmp. Please do not include NFS-mounted filesystems in this list.

Domain               <%= domain %>

* The Servername in dsm.opt must match that of the server stanza in
* dsm.sys. If it is not defined here, then the first server stanza
* in dsm.sys is the default server.

ServerName           <%= server_name %>

* The following lines set up default values for various options. You 
* should not change any of these unless you know what you are doing 
* (i.e. have read the TSM client manual), or under advice from OUCS.
