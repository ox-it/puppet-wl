* Linux/Unix/OSX Client for TSM

* THIS FILE HAS BEEN GENERATED BY PUPPET
* IT SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED BY HAND

* Server settings: these determine which part of the HFS 
* service you back up to. If the installer has found your
* node on a server then it will have automatically configured
* these for you as well as the nodename below. If it failed
* to do so, then they will be commented out.

ServerName           <%= @server_name %>
CommMethod           TCPIP
TcpServerAddress     <%= @server_address %>
TcpPort              <%= @server_port %>

* The nodename identifies your computer to the TSM server.

NodeName             <%= @node_name %>

* The SchedlogName line names a file to which reports from
* scheduled backups will be appended. As below, this log file
* is in the directory /var/log. You might like to change this to
* a different directory if you place log files in general in a
* special place.

SchedLogName         /var/log/dsmsched.log

* When you use the manual dsmc command, error messages go by default
* to a file dsmerror.log in the current user's home directory.
*
* To avoid this you can arrange for all error reports to be appended
* to a single file by specifying a file path with the ErrorlogName 
* option (commented out below).  If you do this then you must make 
* sure it is writable for all users who will be using TSM backup!

ErrorLogName         /var/log/dsmerror.log

* By default all users and members of all groups are permitted to use 
* TSM (permissions on the executables being ok). To restrict this, 
* uncomment the *Users and *Groups lines and substitute as argument a 
* space separated list of usernames and groupnames. If both lines are 
* amended in this manner the users specified and all members of the 
* groups specified will have access to TSM.

* The lines PreScheduleCmd and PostScheduleCmd allow you to specify 
* commands to be executed immediately before and after running a 
* scheduled backup. The scheduler will wait for these commands to 
* complete before continuing. Enclose the commands in double quotes.

*PreScheduleCmd      "command-string"
*PostScheduleCmd     "command-string"

* PostNScheduleCmd allows you to specify a command to be run in the 
* background after a scheduled backup. This can be used to shut down 
* the system after a scheduled backup (often used with the wake-on-lan 
* service). In this case you must specify a delay to allow the scheduled
* backup to report back to the server and exit properly before shutdown 
* starts. Three minutes is usually sufficient.

*PostNScheduleCmd    "shutdown -P +3"

* These lines set up default values for various options.
* You should not change any of these unless you know what you
* are doing (i.e. have read the TSM client manual), or under
* advice from OUCS.

* Virtual Mount Points can be used to backup unsupported filesystems 
* like vfat and ntfs
*
* If you are upgrading and you previously had virtual mount points for
* file systems that are now supported by TSM they will have been
* removed.

* Include/exclude statements determin what gets backed up. You can use
*  Exclude.dir   excludes a directory and everything under it
*  Exclude.fs    excludes an entire mounted filesystem
*  Exclude       excludes matching files
*  Include       include files.
*
* Order matters. Statements lower on the list have higher priority 
* except that Exclude.dir has highest priority wherever it is put in the
* list. Thus to exclude a group of files but include one from within 
* that group the Include statement must come after the Exclude statement
*
* You can use wildcards in the include and exclude statements. These 
* include the shell-like wildcards *, ?, [-], and also /... which 
* matches zero or more directories in a path. See existing statements
* as an example.

Exclude              /.../a.out
Exclude              /.../core
Exclude              /.../*.vmdk
Exclude              /.../*.vmem
Exclude              /.../*.vhd
Exclude              /var/log/lastlog
Exclude.dir          /.../.netscape/cache
Exclude.dir          /var/cache
Exclude.dir          /.../.galeon/mozilla/galeon/Cache
Exclude.dir          /.../.mozilla/firefox/.../Cache
Exclude.dir          /.../.mozilla/default/.../Cache
Exclude.dir          /var/tmp/kdecache*
Exclude.dir          /.../.opera/Cache*
Exclude.dir          /.../.gnome2/epiphany/mozilla/epiphany/Cache
Exclude.dir          /.../.Trash
Exclude.dir          "/.../BBC iPlayer/repository"

* Below are some further recommended Include/Exclude statements you may
* wish to consider.
*
* Do not send ssh-keys to backup server
* Exclude               /.../.ssh/id_*
*
* Uncomment the next two lines if /tmp and /var/tmp are not filesystems
* and you wish to exclude data on them.
*Exclude.dir             /tmp
*Exclude.dir             /var/tmp
* Uncomment the next two lines if /tmp and /var/tmp are mounted filesytems
* and you wish to exclude data on them.
*Exclude.fs              /tmp
*Exclude.fs              /var/tmp
